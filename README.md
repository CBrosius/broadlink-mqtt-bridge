Read the wiki https://github.com/fbacker/broadlink-mqtt-bridge/wiki

It has a Admin GUI for helping record IR / RF signals. You will be able with the filetree see all recorded actions, delete actions and if a disclamation mark occures, this means that the action is a duplicate of another (has same binary content).
